# Adafruit IO Feeds

## What's a feed? 
Feeds hold data and **metadata** about the values you send to Adafruit IO. 

## What are some examples of metadata?
Not only do feeds contain the *value* you sent to Adafruit IO - they contain information about when the value such as what group the data belongs to, when the data was created, and who can see the data.

## How can I send data to a feed?  

You can send data to a feed using either a client library (we have libraries for [Arduino](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_IO_Arduino), [Python](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_IO_Python), and [Go](https://github.com/adafruit/io-client-go)), the [Adafruit IO API](https://io.adafruit.com/api/docs/#tag/Feeds), or the [Adafruit IO MQTT API](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-adafruit-io/mqtt-api-documentation-2#topics-16-3).
  
## What else should I know about feeds?

*Need to change the name of your feed, or other information about it?* [You can edit your feeds through the Adafruit IO web panel](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-io-basics-feeds/editing-a-feed). [You can also share a feed with friends](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-io-basics-feeds/sharing-a-feed) or [download all the data from the feed at once](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-io-basics-feeds/downloading-feed-data).
